        "So, this OCR file works just fine. The OCR models predict the words with good accuracy too. But, those models used comes from DocTR pretrained model, so they are already guaranteed that the result of text extraction will be great. Self trained models will be used if they can work properly with DocTR ocr_predictor function args. Some researches may be conducted for reevaluating and remodeling to updgrade and boost accuracy for OCR model."
